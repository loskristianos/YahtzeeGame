A very simple implementation of a Yahtzee game.

Currently a work-in-progress. The intention is to have a GUI, possibly a frontend that will run in a web browser (or maybe as an Android app), but that's still to come. Runs as a basic, ugly text interface in the console at the minute. 

But this is just for something to do really.
